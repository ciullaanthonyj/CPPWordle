This is a practice project for COSC. I implemented a basis version of Wordle
in C++. It allows you to choose the word and number of attempts you're guessing.

First, clone the project from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ciullaanthonyj/CPPWordle).

```
$ mkdir CPPWordle-build
```

Next, generate build files

```
