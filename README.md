CPPWordle
=============

This is a practice project for COSC. I implemented a basis version of Wordle
in C++. It allows you to choose the word and number of attempts you're guessing.

Build process
-------------
First, clone the project from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ciullaanthonyj/CPPWordle).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ciullaanthonyj/CPPWordle
```

Then create build directory

```
$ mkdir CPPWordle-build
```

and generate Makefile in the build directory, and build the project.

```
$ cmake ./CPPWordle
```
```
$ cmake --build ./CPPWordle-build
```
