=============

This is a practice project for COSC. I implemented a basis version of Wordle
in C++. It allows you to choose the word and number of attempts you're guessing.

Build process
-------------
First, clone the project from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ciullaanthonyj/CPPWordle).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ciullaanthonyj/CPPWordle
```

Then create build directory

```
$ mkdir CPPWordle-build
```

Next, generate build files

```
$ cmake -B CPPWordle-Build -S CPPWordle
```
Build
```
$ cmake --build CPPWordle-build
```
